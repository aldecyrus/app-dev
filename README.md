**Money Heist**
*La casa de Papel*

**Description**
An unusual group of robbers attempt to carry out the most perfect robbery in Spanish history - stealing 2.4 billion euros from the Royal Mint of Spain.
To carry out the biggest heist in history, a mysterious man called the *Professor* recruits a band of eight robbers who have a single characteristic: none of them has anything to lose. Five months of seclusion memorizing every step, evry detail, every probability culminate in eleven days locked up in the *National Coinage* and *Stamp Factory of Spain*, surrounded by police forces and with dozens and with dozens of hostages in their power, to find out whether their suicide wager will lead to everything or nothing.
